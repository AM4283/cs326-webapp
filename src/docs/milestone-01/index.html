        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            In the age of the rapidly growing internet, online shopping has
            become a convenience billions of people rely on worldwide.
            Especially in a post-Covid world, where every aspect of our lives
            has become more solitary, and we are more conscious now than ever
            about leaving our homes, buying goods online, including clothing,
            has become an affordable, safe, and extremely popular option. What
            we aim to solve with this project is navigating the vast internet to
            find the best products at the best prices. StyleScout 360 is a web
            app designed to help consumers get the best price on the items
            they're looking for in one seamless experience, without having to
            visit every site individually and manually compare prices.
            StyleScout finds products the consumer wants on a variety of online
            retailers and deliveries them with a link to purchase them, saving
            the customer the work of having to find the best price themself,
            only to realize later that they missed a site with a better price.
            StyleScout is something anyone who shops online can benefit from
            making use of.

        <div>
          <p>
            The most important component of the StyleScout is, of course, the
            search feature. The search feature is what allows the consumer to
            find the product that they're looking for. There are many different
            ways to search on StyleScout, the simplest being to type in key
            words about the product, which will return a variety of results.
            Users can also search for a specific product and narrow down their
            results using filters, until they find a product they're satisfied
            with. From there, the next component comes in, which is the
            real-time list of prices of any given product on a range of popular
            online shopping sites. This will allow the user to compare prices,
            shipping costs, and other store-specific information about the
            product they're interested in. Finally, the pinnacle of convenience,
            is the wish list. While browsing for items, users can add items they
            find interesting to their personal wish list, which they can access
            at a later date if they're not ready to commit to buying it. They
            can also ask to be notified via email to remind them about the
            product, or get updates on new lower prices or a new seller becoming
            available. Combined with the ease of comparing prices across
            retailers, this component gives the user the most convenient way to
            shop online. StyleScout gives the user all their favorite brands in
            one place, without the hassle of finding deals themself.

        <h2>Wire Frames</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The wireframes below showcase the main functions of StyleScout360,
            as they represent the pages that users will consistently utilize.
            Each of these different wireframes of StyleScout360 will first and
            foremost include a navbar that houses the site logo in the top left
            which acts as a “home” button, a search bar to search for products,
            a button to look in one’s current cart, and an account button to
            access account settings or log-in if the user is not signed-in.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/wireframe1.png" alt="wireframe1" />
          <p>
            The “Home page” is the main view of StyleScout360 that users will
            see when they first enter the site. It is designed to welcome the
            user & immerse the user in various products that are being indexed.
            As a logged-in user, they will be able to view their current orders
            as well as relative tracking info that can be clicked to see more
            in-depth information. Additionally, they will be able to see their
            recently viewed items in case they return to continue their
            shopping. On the sidebar, we have: An orders tab that would take the
            user to the additional details page of their recent orders, A
            wishlist tab that would take the user to their saved items that they
            may have wanted to buy later (or ask someone else to!) A settings
            tab that also lists some basic sections like privacy and security
            where users could go to modify their login information, whether or
            not their search history is being tracked, etc. A saved info panel
            that lets users quickly access their saved payments, search history,
            and addresses so that they can modify them if they wished If a user
            is not signed in, the home page would instead include a
            recommendation view that indexes the current most popular items
            based on site metrics, say previous visits that the user may have
            had on the site.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/wireframe2.png" alt="wireframe2" />
          <p>
            The search page is what a user would see after looking up their
            keywords to try and find relevant products. On this page, like many
            other shopping sites, they will be presented with a list of results
            of products that match their keywords. They have the option to
            filter these results by the site (say they want the shirt to be for
            sure available at a specific retailer), by size, color, etc.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/wireframe3.png" alt="wireframe3" />
          <p>
            On the product details page that a user would encounter after
            selecting a product they wish to view, we find the main appeal of
            StyleScout 360: our price comparison from multiple retailers. On
            this page, we see the product and associated images, as well as a
            list of retailers that are currently selling the product as well as
            the price that they are selling it at, as well as the number of them
            they have available for say, the selected size, if applicable. On
            this page, the user can sort the different store providers by price,
            stock, ratings, etc., and can add the item to their cart (with a
            quantity count if they want to add multiple) or potentially to their
            wishlist. If the user scrolls down, they can find a summarized
            details section that tries to display things like the material &
            measurements of the piece of clothing, if known.
          </p>
          <img src="/img/wireframe4.png" alt="wireframe4" />
          <p>
            The checkout/cart page shows what the user would see after they have
            clicked on their cart and are ready to either check out or remove
            items from the cart. On this page, they see the list of items in
            their cart, the stores they are trying to buy them from, the
            quantity, and the item total (before shipping & tax). The user then
            has the option to add store-applicable coupon codes, as well as
            checkout at the bottom of the page. On our sidebar, we have quick
            access to our saved addresses and payment methods if those need
            changing (for logged-in users).

        <h2>Integrative Experience</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            The StyleScout 360 project ties in deeply with the foundations of
            the Integrative Experience requirement at UMass as the various
            components of the app require skill to execute that is the
            culmination of what one has learned during their time as not only a
            CS undergrad but an undergrad on the diverse campus at UMass. The
            problem that StyleScout 360 attempts to solve is very applicable to
            the real world, and at its core, a humanitarian one. With the advent
            of the digital era and online shopping being more prevalent than
            ever, people are increasingly relying on digital storefronts to buy
            the styles they need. Unlike many other products, shopping for
            clothes requires one to jump through many different sites to compare
            prices, deals, etc., leading many consumers to waste much of their
            valuable time scouring the web to cop a brand-new style.
            Understanding this problem and how one could design a solution such
            as ours is a core part of the general education curriculum presented
            at UMass. The solution is a collaborative endeavor and must be
            presented in an intuitive and easy-to-understand application, all of
            which is the goal of the general education curriculum.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of the technical aspects of the solution, the creation of
            the StyleScout 360 is no easy task. Much of the app requires at
            least an intermediate understanding of various functional
            programming, data structures, and algorithms concepts to design a
            full-stack web app that attempts to interface with so many other
            APIs across the web. If it were to be deployed in the real world,
            the application must be responsive, intuitive, and fast. The search
            algorithms being used must be efficient, the handlers for user
            events robust, and the data structures used to parse API calls to
            other clothing sites understandable. These are all core skills that
            are taught in the CS undergraduate curriculum at UMass that can be
            interconnected with each other to solve the online clothing shopping
            predicament.

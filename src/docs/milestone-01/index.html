        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          In the age of the rapidly growing internet, online shopping has become
          a convenience billions of people rely on worldwide. Especially in a
          post-Covid world, where every aspect of our lives has become more
          solitary, and we are more conscious now than ever about leaving our
          homes, buying goods online, including clothing, has become an
          affordable, safe, and extremely popular option. What we aim to solve
          with this project is navigating the vast internet to find the best
          products at the best prices. StyleScout 360 is a web app designed to
          help consumers get the best price on the items they're looking for in
          one seamless experience, without having to visit every site
          individually and manually compare prices. StyleScout finds products
          the consumer wants on a variety of online retailers and deliveries
          them with a link to purchase them, saving the customer the work of
          having to find the best price themself, only to realize later that
          they missed a site with a better price. StyleScout is something
          anyone who shops online can benefit from making use of.

          The most important component of the StyleScout is, of course, the
          search feature. The search feature is what allows the consumer to find
          the product that they're looking for. There are many different ways to
          search on StyleScout, the simplest being to type in key words about
          the product, which will return a variety of results. Users can also
          search for a specific product and narrow down their results using
          filters, until they find a product they're satisfied with. From there,
          the next component comes in, which is the real-time list of prices of
          any given product on a range of popular online shopping sites. This
          will allow the user to compare prices, shipping costs, and other
          store-specific information about the product they're interested in.
          Finally, the pinnacle of convenience, is the wish list. While browsing
          for items, users can add items they find interesting to their personal
          wish list, which they can access at a later date if they're not ready
          to commit to buying it. They can also ask to be notified via email to
          remind them about the product, or get updates on new lower prices or a
          new seller becoming available. Combined with the ease of comparing
          prices across retailers, this component gives the user the most
          convenient way to shop online. StyleScout gives the user all their
          favorite brands in one place, without the hassle of finding deals
          themself.

            <h2>Data Requirements</h2>
            <p>
                In order for our web application, StyleScout 360, to best serve users, 
                it is necessary to collect various bits of information, both from the user 
                and from the original merchants of the products that will be displayed on the web app. 
                This data will allow StyleScout 360 to efficiently and effectively direct 
                users to the products they are searching for while remaining transparent 
                about the source of each product.
                <br>
                Information from the user will be necessary to provide StyleScout 360 with 
                details on the products they are looking to buy. This information will then be 
                fed into the back end of our application and be used to scrape the web for products 
                relevant to their needs. Other information provided by the user will be used to
                filter through the search results found by the back end to only display products that 
                fit the uses's exact preferences. Our service aims to provide users with the most 
                accurate information on product availability, prices, colors, sizes, etc, and therefore
                will not store information on search results in a database, and instead will scrape 
                the web for currently available products during each search.
                <br>
	            Furthermore, information must be collected from the merchants that are selling the 
                products displayed on our website. First and foremost, it is imperative that the user 
                is provided basic and accurate information about the product they are looking to buy. 
                This includes the name of the item, the photo or photos of the item provided by the site 
                selling the item, and the price of the item. Further information may include size and 
                color options as well as their current availability. Finally, it is important that the 
                user is aware of the original source of each product displayed. In order to ensure this, 
                the name and logo or other identifying information should be collected as well as a link 
                to the product on the original web page. Again, since product listings and prices are 
                frequently updated by the stores that are selling them, this collected information will 
                not be stored in any database for StyleScout 360, and will instead be found dynamically 
                during each search.
                <br>
	            To summarize, our application will take in user input in terms of search keywords and 
                preferences in order to search the web for products that match their needs. In turn, 
                the user will be provided with relevant information on each displayed item directly 
                from the original merchant, as well as a way to view the product directly on the original 
                site.
